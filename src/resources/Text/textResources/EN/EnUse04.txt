Great! Now that I have configured myself correctly I am ready to help you

Wow, I can't wait to help you!

I recommend you read the basic keyword manual to know how to communicate with me
For example, if you want me to search for news, tell me something like "Aurora searches for news"
Or if you want to search for something on the internet, try saying "Aurora, look for what the Milky Way is."

You will have all this and much more in the manual of your Aurora assistant.
